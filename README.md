# Suburban-City-Planning
Suburban City Planning is a comprehensive C++ tool designed to assist urban planners in modeling suburban city layouts. This project utilizes a grid-based system to represent city structures, enabling users to visualize and optimize urban designs effectively. The primary goal is to provide an interactive and adaptable platform for creating efficient road networks and enhancing infrastructure connectivity.

This tool gives the user several visual features including:

Layout Optimization: Designing neighborhoods that balance residential, commercial, and industrial zones while maintaining connectivity.

Infrastructure Planning: Ensuring seamless integration of road networks to support transportation and reduce traffic congestion.

Adaptability: Allowing users to experiment with different city configurations to evaluate the impact of planning decisions.

By integrating advanced pathfinding algorithms, the simulation models efficient road networks that minimize travel time between various city zones. 

Features:

Grid-Based System

This program employs a grid-based system to represent a classic suburban layout. Each grid cell corresponds to a specific city block, which can be designated as residential, commercial, or industrial. The adjacency matrix representation ensures efficient data handling and allows for the seamless integration of additional features in the future.

Pathfinding Algorithms

The tool incorporates robust pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm and Breadth First Search and Minimum Spanning Tree, to model road networks. These algorithms calculate optimal routes between different places. This ensures that the designed road networks are efficient and practical for real-world applications.
